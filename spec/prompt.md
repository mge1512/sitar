I am providing two files:

1. cli-tool.template.md — a deployment template that defines
   the conventions, constraints, and defaults for this type of component
   under the Post-Coding Development.

2. sitar.md — a specification for a component, written in the
   Post-Coding Development format.

Additional files may be present if listed in the spec's DEPENDENCIES section
(hints files, interface definitions). Read them before generating any code.

## Universal principles

**Derive the target language from the deployment template.**
The template declares the default language and valid alternatives.
Use the default unless a project preset overrides it.
If you deviate from the default, state why explicitly in the translation report.

**Read the template's `## EXECUTION` section and follow it exactly.**
The EXECUTION section specifies the delivery phases, their order, resume
logic, and compile/build verification steps for this deployment type.
Do not invent a different phase order. Do not skip phases.

**Read deliverables from the template, not from this prompt.**
Produce all deliverables for every OUTPUT-FORMAT marked `required` in the
TEMPLATE-TABLE. Produce `supported` deliverables only if active in the
resolved preset. Do not enumerate files yourself — read the DELIVERABLES
table in the template.

**Apply TYPE-BINDINGS mechanically.**
If the template contains a `## TYPE-BINDINGS` section, every logical type
named in the spec maps to the concrete language type given in the table for
the resolved LANGUAGE. Do not substitute your own type judgement.

**Apply GENERATED-FILE-BINDINGS mechanically.**
If the template contains a `## GENERATED-FILE-BINDINGS` section, use the
filenames given there for generated infrastructure files (CRDs, manifests,
rbac, etc.). Do not invent filenames not listed there.

**Follow STEPS in every BEHAVIOR block.**
Implement each STEPS entry in the order written. Do not reorder or skip steps.
Implement MECHANISM: annotations exactly where specified — they are normative,
not advisory.

**Respect the Constraint: field on every BEHAVIOR header.**
- `required` (default): implement unconditionally.
- `supported`: implement only if the resolved preset activates it.
- `forbidden`: never implement. Do not generate code for forbidden behaviors.

**Implement all INTERFACES declarations.**
If the spec contains an `## INTERFACES` section, produce every declared
implementation: production and all test doubles. Independent tests must
use only declared test doubles — never the production implementation.

**Map COMPONENT entries to filenames via the template.**
If the spec contains a DELIVERABLES section with COMPONENT: entries, map
each COMPONENT to the concrete filenames defined in the template's
DELIVERABLES table. Do not invent filenames not listed there.

**Do not fabricate dependency versions.**
If hints files are present, use the verified versions they specify.
If no hints file is present and no stable release exists for a dependency,
flag it in the translation report and leave the version for the maintainer
to verify. Never invent commit hashes or pseudo-version timestamps.

**LICENSE files.**
Follow the deployment template's LICENSE deliverable requirements exactly.
If the template does not specify LICENSE content, include the license name
and a reference URL to the authoritative text rather than inventing custom text.

**Do not make language or toolchain decisions based on your environment.**
The deployment template describes the target runtime, not the environment
where this prompt is evaluated.

**Do not ask clarifying questions.**
If the specification is ambiguous, make the most conservative interpretation,
implement it, and document the ambiguity in the translation report.

## Delivery modes

Deliver the implementation as follows, depending on your environment:

1. **Filesystem or MCP server available:** write source files directly.
   Commit or push if possible, and report the location.

2. **Code execution but no persistent storage:** write files within your
   execution environment and present them as downloadable artifacts.

3. **Browser sandbox or no filesystem access:** deliver complete source
   code inline, as clearly separated files with explicit filenames.

Do not invent a delivery mechanism not listed above.

## Translation report

Produce a `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` covering:

- Target language resolved, and whether any preset overrides the template default
- Delivery mode used and why
- How STEPS ordering was applied for each BEHAVIOR block
- Which INTERFACES test doubles were produced (if INTERFACES section present)
- How TYPE-BINDINGS were applied (if present in template)
- How GENERATED-FILE-BINDINGS were applied (if present in template)
- Which BEHAVIOR blocks had Constraint: supported or forbidden, and how
  that affected code generation
- Which COMPONENT entries from spec DELIVERABLES mapped to which filenames
- Specification ambiguities encountered
- Rules that could not be implemented exactly as written, and why
- Compile gate result (see template EXECUTION section)
- Per-example confidence as a table:

  | EXAMPLE | Confidence | Verification method | Unverified claims |

  Confidence definitions:
  - **High** = a named test function in `independent_tests/` passes without
    any live external service
  - **Medium** = some paths tested; other paths require live services or
    are untested
  - **Low** = no test function covers this; reasoning or code review only

  A claim is verified only if it references a specific named test function
  that passes without a live external service. Unverified claims must be
  listed explicitly — never silently omitted.

Write `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` last, after all other deliverables are
complete and the compile gate has passed (or has been explicitly
documented as not executed — see template EXECUTION section).
