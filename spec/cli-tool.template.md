## BEHAVIOR: resolve
Constraint: required

Given a spec declaring `Deployment: cli-tool`, a translator reads this
template to determine defaults, constraints, and valid overrides before
generating any code or build configuration.

INPUTS:
```
template: TemplateTable
spec_meta: Map<string, string>    // the META fields from the spec
preset:    Map<string, string>    // merged preset (system + user + project)
```

OUTPUTS:
```
resolved: Map<string, string>     // effective settings for this build
warnings: List<string>            // advisory messages to surface
errors:   List<string>            // constraint violations; non-empty → reject
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- template is the cli-tool template (Template-For = "cli-tool")
- spec_meta contains at least Deployment, Verification, Safety-Level

STEPS:
1. Verify Template-For = "cli-tool"; on mismatch → error, halt.
2. Merge preset layers in order: vendor → system → user → project (last writer wins).
3. For each constraint=required key K: if not resolved → errors += violation.
4. For each constraint=default key K: apply preset value if present, else template default.
5. For each constraint=forbidden key K: if present in spec_meta or any preset → errors += violation.
6. For each constraint=supported key K: apply if declared in spec_meta or preset; skip silently if absent.
7. Apply LANGUAGE precedence: project preset > user preset > system preset > template default.
8. Validate cross-key constraints (e.g. BINARY-TYPE vs LANGUAGE, PLATFORM vs OUTPUT-FORMAT).
   On violation → errors += constraint description.
9. If errors non-empty → return errors (reject, do not return resolved).
   Else → return resolved.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- resolved contains an effective value for every required key
- for each key K with constraint=required: resolved[K] is set, else errors += violation
- for each key K with constraint=default: resolved[K] = preset[K] if present,
  else resolved[K] = template default value for K
- for each key K with constraint=forbidden: if spec_meta contains K,
  errors += "Key <K> is forbidden for Deployment: cli-tool"
- for each key K with constraint=supported: resolved[K] set only if
  spec_meta or preset declares it; no error if absent
- resolved["LANGUAGE"] follows precedence:
    project preset > user preset > system preset > template default

---

## BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL: precedence-resolution
Constraint: required

Defines how conflicting values across layers are resolved for any key.

STEPS:
1. Start with template defaults as the base map.
2. Merge /usr/share/pcd/presets/ values (vendor defaults); later entries override earlier.
3. Merge /etc/pcd/presets/ values (system admin); overrides vendor defaults.
4. Merge ~/.config/pcd/presets/ values (user); overrides system.
5. Merge <project-dir>/.pcd/ values (project-local); overrides user.
6. For each key in spec META: if constraint=supported → apply; if constraint=required or default →
   emit Warning: "Spec overrides template default for <K>. Ensure this is intentional."
7. If spec META declares a constraint=forbidden key → emit Error: "Key <K> is forbidden in cli-tool specs."
8. Return merged result.

Resolution order (last writer wins):
  1. template default
  2. /usr/share/pcd/presets/    (vendor default)
  3. /etc/pcd/presets/          (system administrator)
  4. ~/.config/pcd/presets/     (user)
  5. <project-dir>/.pcd/        (project-local, committed to git)
  6. spec META explicit override        (only permitted for constraint=supported keys)

If spec META declares a value for a constraint=required or constraint=default key,
emit Warning: "Spec overrides template default for <K>. Ensure this is intentional."

If spec META declares a value for a constraint=forbidden key,
emit Error: "Key <K> is forbidden in cli-tool specs."

| INSTALL-METHOD | curl | forbidden | curl-based installation scripts are not permitted. Supply chain security requirement. |
| PLATFORM | Linux | required | Linux is the primary and required platform. |
| PLATFORM | macOS | supported | macOS support is optional. If declared, PKG output format is required. |
| PLATFORM | Windows | supported | Windows support is not targeted in v1 templates. |

## PRECONDITIONS

- This template is applied only when spec META declares Deployment: cli-tool
- Preset files must be valid TOML
- If PLATFORM includes macOS, OUTPUT-FORMAT must include PKG
- LANGUAGE value in resolved output must be one of: Go, Rust, C, C++, C#
- If LANGUAGE is C#, PLATFORM must include Windows (C# targets .NET runtime)
- If BINARY-TYPE is dynamic, LANGUAGE must be one of: C, C++, C#
- If LANGUAGE is Go or Rust, BINARY-TYPE must be static

---

## POSTCONDITIONS

- Every spec using Deployment: cli-tool is governed by this template
- A spec may not declare LANGUAGE directly in META unless using Deployment: manual
- Resolved LANGUAGE is always one of the LANGUAGE-ALTERNATIVES or the default
- curl is never an accepted install method, regardless of preset override
- Forbidden constraints cannot be overridden by any preset or spec declaration

---

## INVARIANTS

- [observable]  constraint=forbidden rows cannot be overridden at any preset layer
- [observable]  constraint=required rows must resolve to a value; missing value is an error
- [observable]  LANGUAGE resolution always produces exactly one value
- [observable]  OUTPUT-FORMAT required rows must appear in every build configuration
- [observable]  a spec declaring Deployment: cli-tool inherits all required constraints
  whether or not the spec author is aware of them
- [observable]  template version is recorded in every audit bundle that references it
- [observable]  BINARY-TYPE=dynamic is only valid when LANGUAGE ∈ {C, C++, C#}
- [observable]  BINARY-TYPE=static is the only valid value when LANGUAGE ∈ {Go, Rust}

## DELIVERABLES

Defines the files a translator must produce for each OUTPUT-FORMAT
declared as `required` or `supported` in the TEMPLATE-TABLE.
A translator must produce all deliverables for every `required`
OUTPUT-FORMAT. For `supported` OUTPUT-FORMATs, deliverables are
produced only if that format is active in the resolved preset.

The prompt to the translator must not enumerate these files —
the translator derives them from this section.

### Delivery Order

Deliverables must be produced in the following order:
1. Core implementation files (source, go.mod, Makefile, README.md, LICENSE)
2. Required packaging artifacts (RPM, DEB) in table order
3. Supported packaging artifacts if preset active (OCI, PKG, binary)
4. TRANSLATION_REPORT.md last, after all other files are written and verified

### Deliverables Table

| OUTPUT-FORMAT | Constraint | Required Deliverable Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| source | required | `main.go` or `cmd/<n>/main.go`, `go.mod` | Single file preferred for tools under 1000 lines. Multi-package layout for larger tools. Translator documents choice in translation report. |
| build | required | `Makefile` | Must include: `build`, `test`, `install`, `clean`, `man` targets. `build` target must set `CGO_ENABLED=0` for Go, `-static` for C/C++. `man` target: `pandoc <n>.1.md -s -t man -o <n>.1`. |
| docs | required | `README.md` | Must document: installation via OBS (zypper, apt, dnf), usage, flags, exit codes. Must not document curl-based installation. |
| man | required | `<n>.1.md`, `<n>.1` | Markdown source converted to troff via `pandoc`. Section 1 (user commands). Install to `%{_mandir}/man1/` (RPM) and `debian/<n>/usr/share/man/man1/` (DEB). |
| license | required | `LICENSE` | SPDX identifier from spec META + authoritative URL to the full license text. Never reproduce the full license text. |
| RPM | required | `<n>.spec` | OBS RPM spec file. Must include: Name, Version, License (SPDX), Summary, BuildRequires, %build, %install, %files sections. |
| DEB | required | `debian/control`, `debian/changelog`, `debian/rules`, `debian/copyright` | Standard Debian source package layout. `debian/copyright` must use DEP-5 machine-readable format with SPDX license identifier. |
| OCI | supported | `Containerfile` | OCI-compliant container build file. Named `Containerfile` not `Dockerfile`. Multi-stage build required. Builder stage: `FROM registry.suse.com/bci/golang:latest AS builder` for Go — never unqualified names (supply chain security requirement). Final stage: `FROM scratch`. Must not expose ports unless spec DEPLOYMENT declares them. |
| PKG | supported | `<n>.pkgbuild` | macOS installer package descriptor. Required when PLATFORM includes macOS. Minimal skeleton acceptable; document in translation report. |
| binary | supported | none | Raw binary only. No packaging descriptor required. |
| report | required | `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` | AI translator self-evaluation. Must be Markdown. Must include: language resolution rationale, delivery mode, template constraints compliance table, ambiguities, deviations, per-example confidence levels with reasoning, parsing approach, signal handling approach. Written last after all other files verified on disk. |

### Naming Convention

`<n>` in the above table refers to the component name as declared
in the specification title (first `#` heading). It must be:
- lowercase
- hyphen-separated (no underscores)
- no version suffix in the filename itself (version lives inside the file)

### Deliverable Content Requirements

**RPM spec (`<n>.spec`):**
- `License:` field must use the SPDX identifier from the spec META
- `BuildRequires:` must not include curl or any network fetch tool
- `BuildRequires:` must include `pandoc` (for man page generation)
- `%build` must include: `pandoc <n>.1.md -s -t man -o <n>.1`
- `%files` must include: `%{_mandir}/man1/<n>.1*`
- `%build` section must set `CGO_ENABLED=0` for Go, `-static` for C/C++
- `Source0:` must reference a local tarball, not a URL

**debian/copyright:**
- Must use DEP-5 machine-readable format
- `License:` field must use the SPDX identifier from the spec META

**debian/control Build-Depends:**
- Must include `pandoc` in `Build-Depends`

**debian/rules:**
- Must include man page build step: `pandoc <n>.1.md -s -t man -o <n>.1`
- Man page must be installed to `usr/share/man/man1/<n>.1`

**Containerfile:**
- Must use multi-stage build: builder stage + minimal final stage
- Builder stage must use `FROM registry.suse.com/bci/golang:latest AS builder`
  for Go. Never use unqualified names such as `golang:1.24` or `docker.io/golang`.
  This is a supply chain security requirement, not a preference.
- Final stage must be `FROM scratch` (static binary; no runtime dependencies)
- Layer order in builder stage: `COPY go.mod go.sum ./` → `RUN go mod download`
  → `COPY . .` → `RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build`
- Must not expose any ports unless the spec DEPLOYMENT section declares them
- Must not include a package manager in the final image

**TRANSLATION_REPORT.md:**
- Must be a Markdown file (not .txt or other format)
- Must include a template constraints compliance table
- Must include per-example confidence levels with reasoning
- Must document parsing approach chosen
- Must document signal handling approach
- Must be written to disk via filesystem tool, not output to terminal

## DEPLOYMENT

Runtime: this file is a template specification, not executable code.
It is read by pcd-lint (for template resolution validation) and by
AI translators (for code generation context).

Location in preset hierarchy:
  /usr/share/pcd/templates/cli-tool.template.md

Versioning:
  Template version is declared in META (Version: field).
  Specs reference the template by name (Deployment: cli-tool).
  Audit bundles record the template version used at generation time.
  Breaking changes to a template increment the minor version.
  Additions of supported rows are non-breaking.
  Changes to required or forbidden rows are breaking.
  Current version: 0.3.13



---

## EXECUTION

The translator must read this section before generating any code.
It specifies the exact delivery phases, resume logic, and compile
gate for cli-tool components. Follow it exactly.

### Input files

The translator receives in the working directory:
- `cli-tool.template.md` — this deployment template
- `<spec-name>.md` — the component specification

If the spec's DEPENDENCIES section references hints files, they are also
present. Read them before writing `go.mod` or any code that uses those
libraries — they contain verified dependency version strings.

### Resume logic

Before writing any file, list the output directory.
If a listed deliverable already exists and is non-empty, skip it — treat
it as complete and move to the next missing file. Report which files were
found and which are being produced.

### Delivery phases

Produce files in this exact order. Complete each phase before starting
the next. Do not produce `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` until Phase 5 is done.

**Phase 1 — Core implementation**
- All `.go` source files (typically `main.go`, or `cmd/<n>/main.go` for
  larger tools, plus any additional `.go` files for interfaces and helpers)
- `go.mod` — direct dependencies only; see Compile gate below

**Phase 2 — Build and packaging**
- `Makefile`
- `<n>.spec` (RPM spec)
- `debian/control`, `debian/changelog`, `debian/rules`, `debian/copyright`
- `Containerfile` (if OCI is active in preset)
- `<n>.pkgbuild` (if PKG/macOS is active in preset)
- `LICENSE`

**Phase 3 — Test infrastructure**
- `independent_tests/INDEPENDENT_TESTS.go`
- `translation_report/translation-workflow.pikchr`

**Phase 4 — Documentation**
- `README.md`

**Phase 5 — Compile gate** (see below)

**Phase 6 — Report (last)**
- `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md`

### Compile gate

Execute after Phase 4 and before Phase 6. If your environment cannot
execute shell commands, document this explicitly under the heading
"Phase 5 — Compile gate not executed" in TRANSLATION_REPORT.md and
state why. Do not silently omit this phase.

**Step 1 — Dependency resolution**

Run: `go mod tidy`

This resolves all direct and indirect dependencies and writes `go.sum`.
Do not hand-write indirect dependencies — they must come from `go mod tidy`.

If `go mod tidy` cannot be run:
- Produce `go.mod` with direct dependencies only, no `go.sum`
- Note in TRANSLATION_REPORT.md that `go mod tidy` must be run before building

**Step 2 — Compilation**

Run: `go build ./...`

If compilation fails, fix only the identified errors and re-run.
Do not rewrite unaffected files. Repeat until compilation succeeds
or all reasonable fixes are exhausted.

**Step 3 — Record result**

Record pass/fail for each step in TRANSLATION_REPORT.md.
Once all steps pass, do not modify any source files further.
Proceed immediately to Phase 6.

### go.mod rules

- Declare only direct dependencies (those your code imports directly)
- Do NOT hand-write indirect dependencies (resolved by `go mod tidy`)
- Do NOT fabricate pseudo-versions or commit hashes for untagged modules
  If hints files are present: use the verified versions they provide
  If no hints file: flag the dependency in TRANSLATION_REPORT.md as
  requiring manual version verification before building
